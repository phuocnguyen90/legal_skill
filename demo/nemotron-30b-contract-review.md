| Section | Content (summary) |
| --- | --- |
| **Scope of Services / Fees** | ₫15,000,000 (inclusive of all government fees, **ex‑VAT 10 %**). Payment: 80 % upfront, 20 % on completion. Price valid 15 days. |

## 2\. Clause‑by‑Clause Analysis

| #   | Clause (as extracted) | Classification | Rationale & Play‑book Alignment | Red‑line / Suggested Revision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Scope of Services & Fees** – “PHI DỊCH VỤ” section, price 15 M VND, includes government fees, excludes VAT, 80 % advance, 20 % on completion, price valid 15 days. | **GREEN** | • The scope is clearly defined.  <br>• Price includes all fees (consistent with standard practice).  <br>• Payment schedule is typical for professional services. | No change needed. Optionally add: “The advance payment is non‑refundable only if the Service Provider fails to commence the Services.” |
| **2** | **Implementation Timeline** – “20 ngày làm việc” to complete the work. | **GREEN** | • Reasonable time‑frame; aligns with a short‑term engagement. | No change needed. |
| **3** | **Customer Information to be Provided** – Detailed personal data of the foreign company’s representatives (passport numbers, birth‑dates, address, nationality, etc.). | **YELLOW** | • Collection of personal data triggers data‑protection obligations.  <br>• No safeguards, purpose limitation, or retention policy are mentioned. | **Suggested language (redline):**  <br>`\nThe Customer shall provide the Personal Data listed below solely for the purpose of preparing and filing the registration with the competent Vietnamese authority. The Service Provider shall (i) process such Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Customer, (ii) implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures, (iii) retain the data no longer than 30 days after completion of the Services, and (iv) delete or return the data on the Customer’s request. A separate Data Processing Agreement shall be executed prior to processing.` |
| **4** | **Required Documents to be Submitted** – Passport copies, incumbency certificates, “Giấy phép hoạt động”, etc. | **YELLOW** | • Same data‑protection concerns as above; also raises risk of using third‑party sub‑processors (e.g., government agencies). | **Suggested language (redline):**  <br>`\nThe Service Provider shall (a) use the submitted documents only for the purpose of the registration filing, (b) ensure that any sub‑processor engaged for the filing is bound by the same confidentiality and data‑protection obligations, and (c) certify destruction of all copies of the documents within 15 days after the filing is completed, unless otherwise required by law.` |
| **5** | **Broad Disclaimer of Liability** – “​We are not responsible for the accuracy … of any document or information provided by you …” | **RED** | • Attempts to waive **all** liability for any loss arising from inaccurate customer‑provided data, which is over‑broad and may be unenforceable under Vietnamese law.  <br>• Conflicts with the play‑book’s **Limitation of Liability** standard (mutual cap at 12 months of fees; acceptable range 6‑24 months). | **Redline amendment:**  <br>`\nExcept for liability arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Service Provider’s total aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the total fees actually paid by the Customer during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. The Service Provider shall not be liable for any indirect, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profit or reputation. The Service Provider remains liable for any breach of its confidentiality or data‑protection obligations.` |
| **6** | **Payment Terms (80 % advance, 20 % on completion) & Non‑Refundable Advance** | **YELLOW** | • Advance is labelled “non‑refundable”, which may be unfair if the Service Provider fails to commence work.  <br>• No milestone‑based triggers tied to deliverables; payment is tied only to “completion” which is vague. | **Redline amendment (payment schedule):**  <br>`\nThe Customer shall pay 30 % of the total fee upon execution of this Agreement (the “Initial Payment”), a further 40 % upon delivery of the draft registration package to the Customer (“Milestone 1”), and the remaining 30 % upon successful filing with the competent authority (“Milestone 2”). The Initial Payment is refundable if the Service Provider elects to terminate the Agreement for convenience prior to commencing Milestone 1.` |
| **7** | **Absence of any Limitation of Liability / Indemnification / IP / Confidentiality / Term / Termination / Governing Law / Dispute Resolution clauses** | **RED** (multiple risk areas) | • The play‑book requires **mutual limitation of liability**, **mutual indemnification for IP infringement & data‑breach**, **clear IP ownership**, **confidentiality**, **term & termination**, and **governing law / arbitration**.  <br>• Their omission leaves the Agreement incomplete and exposes the Customer to unlimited exposure. | **Proposed new clauses (redline examples):**  <br>**Limitation of Liability** (see #5 amendment).  <br>**Indemnification**:  <br>`\nEach Party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from any third‑party claim, loss, or damage arising out of (i) a breach of this Agreement, (ii) infringement of any intellectual‑property right, or (iii) a data‑protection violation caused by the indemnifying Party’s performance of the Services. The indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim to the extent such claim results from the other Party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n`  <br>**Intellectual Property**:  <br>`\nAll pre‑existing intellectual property of each Party shall remain the exclusive property of that Party. Any materials, documents, or filings prepared by the Service Provider that are based on the Customer’s information shall be owned by the Customer. The Service Provider shall have a non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to use such materials solely for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement.\n`  <br>**Confidentiality**:  <br>`\nBoth Parties shall keep confidential all non‑public information disclosed by the other Party for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure, except where required by law. The obligations shall not apply to information that (a) is already publicly known, (b) becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving Party, or (c) is independently developed without reference to the disclosing Party’s confidential information.\n`  <br>**Term & Termination**:  <br>`\nThis Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for twelve (12) months, automatically renewing for successive twelve‑month periods unless either Party provides written notice of non‑renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then‑current term. Either Party may terminate for convenience upon thirty (30) days’ written notice, or immediately for material breach. Upon termination, the Service Provider shall (i) cease all processing of the Customer’s Personal Data, (ii) return or destroy all confidential information, and (iii) invoice only for Services performed up to the termination date.\n`  <br>**Governing Law & Dispute Resolution**:  <br>`\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, without regard to its conflict‑of‑laws principles. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the Vietnam International Arbitration Centre (VIAC) in accordance with its Rules, with the seat of arbitration in Ho Chi Minh City. The language of the arbitration proceedings shall be English.\n` |
| **8** | **No Confidentiality Clause** (implicit) | **YELLOW** | • No explicit duty to protect each other’s confidential information. | Use the **Confidentiality** clause suggested above. |
| **9** | **No Data‑Processing Agreement (DPA)** | **RED** | • Processing of passport copies and personal data requires a DPA under Vietnamese data‑protection law and potentially GDPR. | Incorporate the **Data Protection** language (Clause 3 & 4 suggestions) and attach a DPA as an annex. |
| **10** | **No Force‑Majeure / Entire Agreement / Acceptance provisions** | **YELLOW** | • While not critical for a short‑term service quote, they provide clarity on continuation and how the agreement may be modified. | Add a brief **Force‑Majeure** clause (standard wording) and an **Entire Agreement** clause stating that this document (including any annexes) constitutes the entire agreement and that any amendment must be in writing signed by both parties. |

## 3\. Summary of Risk Classification

| Severity | Number of Clauses | Typical Remedy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **RED** | 4 (Liability disclaimer, missing Limitation/Indemnity/IP/Confidentiality/Data‑Protection/Governing‑Law) | Immediate senior‑legal review; negotiate or insert protective clauses before signing. |
| **YELLOW** | 5 (Payment schedule, confidentiality, term/termination, force‑majeure, acceptance) | Negotiate revisions; can be accepted if the counterpart is willing to add standard boilerplate. |
| **GREEN** | 2 (Scope of Services, Implementation Timeline) | No changes required; can be left as‑is. |

## 4\. Recommended Next Steps for the Customer

1.  **Escalate the RED items** (Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Data‑Protection, Governing Law, and the overly broad liability disclaimer) to senior counsel for formal negotiation.
2.  **Insert the suggested boilerplate** (Limitation of Liability, Indemnification,
